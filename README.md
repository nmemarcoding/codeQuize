# codeQuize
##Your Task
* As you proceed in your journey to becoming a full-stack web developer, it’s likely that you’ll be asked to complete a coding assessment, perhaps as part of an interview process. A typical coding assessment is a combination of multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges.
* To help you become familiar with these tests and give you a chance to apply the skills from this module, this week’s Challenge invites you to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. This week’s coursework will teach you all the skills you need to succeed in this assignment.
### NOTE
* Coding assessments are an important part of the interview process for developers. In fact, employers often use them to filter out job candidates with a cut-off score. To help you prepare, we’ve developed a set of technical interview questions that you can answer throughout the course. The difficulty level of these questions will increase as you become a more proficient developer. If you take advantage of these opportunities to practice, you should be well-prepared to shine during the technical interview process toward the end of this course!
